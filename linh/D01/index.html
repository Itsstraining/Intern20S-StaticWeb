        WTF is Mukbang and Why Should You Watch these Viral Korean Videos? An Explainer
      </h1>
      <p>Slurping, chewing, chomping, and binging. Would you watch others scarf down large platefuls of foods?
          <br/>Thousands of people are watching these Korean videos, called “mukbang”.
          <br>What’s a <i><b>mukbang</b></i>? It’s a YouTube trend from South Korea that started around 2010. In a mukbang video, the YouTuber or BJ (“Broadcast Jockey,” a unique-to-Korea term for a vlogger) eats loads of food while narrating and interacting with their audience. While the craze started in South Korea, it’s migrated across the world.

        How to Learn Korean with Mukbang
        </h2>
        <p>
            So how do you use mukbang to learn Korean? Well, mukbang can actually be a useful tool for learning. It often features young, trendy hosts using the most current slang and language.
            <br>You’ll pick up how to describe food in painstaking detail, and you’ll never forget your vocab for the food after this. Plus, the uniqueness of mukbang makes it stick in your memory more than hearing it from a textbook. The specific topic (food and eating) gives you easy context to infer words. That makes it simpler to listen and understand than, say, a popular K-Drama.
            <br>One of the first places you can start when learning Korean is 90 Day Korean Inner Circle. It’s the best way to learn Korean fast, having a conversation in as little as 90 days. And you’ll use the 80/20 principle to memorize all the essentials of the language to get you going. They even have a module dedicated to learning slang and understanding dramas and videos like this. So it’s perfect to prepare.
            <br>Then, you can find the best mukbang videos and live-streams at AfreecaTV. Since this is where it all started, it’s where you’ll find the most current trends.
            <br>But, there’s also mukbang channels on YouTube to check out. Mukbangers like:<br>
